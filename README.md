# AutoForm (JSON Schema prototype)

AutoForm is an experiment that renders a very small set of UI controls directly from a JSON Schema document. The current focus is
feeding it with the output of [`z.toJSONSchema`](https://zod.dev/?id=json-schema) from **Zod v4**, so we can preview large schemas
(such as the "kitchen sink" test schema) without hand-coding every field.

---

## Overview

- **Input:** a JSON Schema object. Internally the component resolves `$ref` values defined in `$defs` so that reused fields become
directly renderable (`replaceRefs` in [`auto-form.tsx`](src/components/autoform/auto-form.tsx)).
- **Renderer:** [`AutoField`](src/components/autoform/auto-field.tsx) picks a basic control for each property based on its `type`,
`format`, and helpers like `enum`, `anyOf`, and `additionalProperties`.
- **Status:** intentionally lightweight â€“ there is no React Hook Form integration yet, and validation/submission wiring is out of
scope for this prototype.

## What currently renders

The renderer covers the pieces of JSON Schema that fall out of the Zod v4 conversion:

- Strings map to text inputs and honour formats: `email`, `uri`, `date-time` (`<DatePicker /> + time input`), `date`, and `time`.
- Numbers and integers share a numeric input.
- Booleans render as checkboxes.
- Enumerations become a Radix `Select` listing the available options.
- Arrays display the schema for the first item (tuples pick the first entry, homogeneous arrays reuse the item schema).
- Objects with explicit `properties` render nested lists; record-like objects that use `additionalProperties` show a key/value row
and respect any `propertyNames.pattern` constraint for the key field.
- `anyOf` chooses the first option for now (future work could surface all variants).
- The literal `null` type renders as a static "null" placeholder.

The [`test/kitchen-sink-schema.ts`](test/kitchen-sink-schema.ts) fixture exercises most of these cases and provides the example
schema used by the local demo page.

## Usage

### 1. Produce JSON Schema (Zod v4 example)

```ts
import { z } from "zod";

const User = z.object({
  name: z.string().min(1),
  email: z.email(),
  website: z.string().url().optional(),
  tags: z.array(z.string()).min(1),
  role: z.enum(["admin", "editor", "viewer"]),
});

const userJsonSchema = z.toJSONSchema(User, { reused: "ref" });
```

`z.toJSONSchema` is optional; any JSON Schema object with the shapes listed above will work.

### 2. Render the form

```tsx
import { AutoForm } from "@/components/autoform/auto-form";

export function UserPreview() {
  return (
    <div className="max-w-xl space-y-4">
      <AutoForm schema={userJsonSchema} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

The component automatically resolves `$ref` definitions before rendering, so schemas that reuse components (e.g. addresses) will
show fully inlined fields.

---

## Limitations & next steps

This is a prototype; important gaps remain:

- Only the first branch of an `anyOf` is displayed.
- Arrays are rendered as a single set of controls (no add/remove UI yet).
- There is no form state library wiring, validation messages, labels, or submission handling.
- Formats beyond the ones listed above fall back to plain inputs.
- Complex widgets (files, discriminated unions, recursive data) need dedicated UX.

Despite the limitations, the component is already useful for quickly visualising the overall shape of large schemas while we iterate
on richer form-generation features.
